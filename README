Sometimes you just read text inside vim. You spend hours in Normal mode, not doing nothing, just scrolling text and pressing hjkl keys all the time. In such situations this script becomes very useful.
To enter Auto Scroll Mode, install this script first,
and than activate it pressing <F21> key from Normal mode (Pause on keyboard)
To start scrolling text type 'l', for more info read next section.

COMMANDS

 Commands used in Auto Scroll Mode to change how Vim will scroll text
